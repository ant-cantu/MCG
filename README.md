## About MCG

This is a simple project I made to make my life a little bit easier at work.

Sometimes chassis are needed to look up parts in the parts catalog, when first starting out you either
remember the vehicle chassis numbers or you have to look them up manually.

## Built With

## Getting Started

This is a standalone application, no installation is required.

1. Download the file
> https://github.com/ant-cantu/MCG/blob/main/MCG/MCG/bin/Debug/MCG.exe

2. Run the application
3. Enter vehicle year and model

## Usage

This application allows you to type in the year and model of a vehicle and it will give you 
the chassis number, engine number, and transmission number. It will automatically copy the chassis number 
to your clipboard and you can also return later and click the arrow next to the year and model of an already 
entered vehicle to copy the chassis to your clipboard once again.
